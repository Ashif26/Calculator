A calculator created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a basic web application that allows users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The HTML structure provides the layout of the calculator, including the display screen and buttons for digits and operations. CSS is used to style the calculator, making it visually appealing and user-friendly. JavaScript handles the functionality, enabling the buttons to interact with the display and perform calculations when pressed. This project demonstrates fundamental web development skills by combining structure, style, and interactivity.
